# Overview of the project  

The aim of this project is to investigate the **fortresses in Romagna**. The focus is on the figure of [**Caterina Sforza**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Sforza), Italian noblewoman, the Countess of ForlÃ¬ and Lady of Imola.

The main goal is to create a new set of RDF triples regarding the ArCo ontology to enrich the ArCo Knowledge Graph. Possible improvements have been proposed with regards to: 

- Depiction

- Date in time

- Commissioner 

# Research Methodology 

The methodology section describes the approach and processes used to investigate the **architectural heritage** in Romagna linked to the historical figure of **Caterina Sforza**. 

The following steps outline the key phases of the research:

1. Exploration of the ArCo ontologies and knowledge graphs through the ArCo SPARQL Editor

2. Usage of SPARQL query Language

3. Usage of LLMs to retrieve pieces of information to enrich the KG and prompting techniques to generate the best responses

4. Usage of GitHub to publish a website

> What is ArCo SPARQL Query Editor? 
>
> The ArCo SPARQL Query Editor is a tool used for querying the ArCo Knowledge Graph. The editor allows users to write and execute SPARQL queries and therefore access and explore the dataset. Querying the editor also provides the opportunity to explore relationships between different entities: such relationships are specified by the ArCo ontologies.

> What is SPARQL Query Language?
>
> SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language and protocol for querying and manipulating data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.

> What is a Large Language Model?
>
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are typically based on deep learning techniques and are trained on vast amounts of text data.

> What are prompting techniques?
>
> Prompting techniques are methods used to elicit specific responses or behaviors from AI models, particularly language models. These techniques are crucial for guiding the AI to produce relevant and accurate outputs based on the provided inputs.
> The prompting techniques used for our project are the following two: 

> What is GitHub? 
>
> GitHub is a web platform for managing and collaborating on code using Git. It allows developers to store their projects in repositories, track changes, and work on different parts of a project through branches. Key features include pull requests for reviewing and merging changes, issue tracking for managing tasks and bugs, and GitHub Actions for automating tasks like testing and deployment. GitHub supports both public and private projects.
